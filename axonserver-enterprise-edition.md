# AxonServer Enterprise Edition

A cluster is defined to guarantee high availability. 

Multiple connection points for (Axon Framework-based) client applications, and thus share the load of managing message delivery and event storage. Client applications will dynamically connect to a node in the cluster and automatically reconnect to another, should the node that they are currently connected to become unreachable.â€Œ

Clustering and Multi-Context features are only available in Axon Server Enterprise Edition.
